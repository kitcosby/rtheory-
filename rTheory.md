R-Theory Projections

Dimensionless, Governed Modeling Across Physics

Overview

This repository contains a set of dimensionless physics projections implemented as ratio-based, bounded, and governed computational frames.

These projections do not assert what reality is.
They provide a disciplined way to model, compare, and cross-validate physical formalisms (quantum mechanics, relativity, statistics, gravitation) without units, preferred frames, or ontological claims.

The guiding principle is simple:

Strip everything down to ratios, invariants, and constraints.
Observe what survives.

⸻

What This Repository Is
	•	A projection framework, not a physical theory
	•	A structure-first modeling discipline
	•	A safe environment for exploration, including AI-assisted reasoning
	•	A way to study failure modes, not just successful regimes

Each projection:
	•	Uses only dimensionless ratios
	•	Enforces boundedness and invariants
	•	Halts on violation instead of inventing explanations
	•	Produces residuals, not narratives

⸻

What This Repository Is Not
	•	❌ A replacement for established physics
	•	❌ An interpretation of quantum mechanics
	•	❌ A metaphysical or ontological claim
	•	❌ A unification theory
	•	❌ A source of physical constants or measurements

Any attempt to use these projections to declare “what reality fundamentally is” is explicitly inadmissible.

Core Idea: Dimensionless Projection

All quantities are expressed as ratios to declared reference anchors (e.g. c, \hbar, k_B), then normalized away.

What remains:
	•	Phase
	•	Constraint
	•	Invariance
	•	Failure

This removes:
	•	Unit systems
	•	Absolute frames
	•	Interpretive baggage
	•	Implicit metaphysics

⸻

Included Projections

Quantum Mechanics (QM-PROJ-01)
	•	Wavefunctions treated as relational phase ratios
	•	Unitary evolution enforced
	•	Probability normalization is strict
	•	Ontological realism explicitly forbidden

Relativity (REL-PROJ-01)
	•	Velocities, time, and length expressed as ratios
	•	No preferred frame by construction
	•	Superluminal states are inadmissible
	•	Dynamics reduce to constrained boosts

Statistical Mechanics (STAT-PROJ-01)
	•	Entropy, information, and free energy as ratios
	•	Normalization is invariant
	•	Partition collapse halts computation
	•	No “ensemble reality” allowed

Gravitation (GRAV-PROJ-01)
	•	Curvature treated as relational deviation ratios
	•	No spacetime substance assumptions
	•	Metric overflow halts instead of forming singularities

Foundations / Cross-Linking (FND-PROJ-01)
	•	Couples all projections into a shared phase manifold
	•	Computes cross-domain sensitivity (crosslink matrix)
	•	Enforces antisymmetry and anchor consistency
	•	Identifies where domains destabilize each other

Emergent Cross-Field Patterns

Once everything is dimensionless, the same structures appear across fields:
	1.	Boundedness is universal
Limits are approached asymmetrically and never crossed.
	2.	Dynamics reduce to constrained phase rotation
Evolution is rotation under invariance, not substance flow.
	3.	Information outlives energy
Normalization, unitarity, and conservation survive unit removal.
	4.	Singularities disappear
They are replaced by saturation, tolerance failure, and halting.
	5.	Stable couplings are antisymmetric
Amplifying feedback loops are inadmissible.
	6.	No preferred frame survives reduction
If a model needs one, it fails here.

These patterns are observations, not claims.

Governance and Safety

This repository includes a deterministic governance module (GOV-MODULE-01) that enforces:
	•	Separation of output and audit data
	•	Residual reporting instead of rhetorical explanation
	•	Ontology detection and suppression
	•	Deterministic replay
	•	Re-entry gating for admissibility

This makes the framework suitable for:
	•	AI-assisted reasoning
	•	Automated exploration
	•	Formal verification
	•	High-risk conceptual work

Exploration is allowed.
Re-entry as “truth” is not.

How to Use This Repository

Typical uses include:
	•	Comparing physical formalisms without unit bias
	•	Studying breakdown regimes safely
	•	Detecting hidden assumptions in models
	•	Preventing AI systems from laundering speculation into fact
	•	Building higher-level projections on a governed base

If a computation violates constraints, the correct response is to stop and log, not to explain it away.

⸻

Design Philosophy
	•	Projection over assertion
	•	Ratios over quantities
	•	Constraints over stories
	•	Residuals over persuasion
	•	Structure over ontology

If you are looking for answers to “what is real?”, this repository is not for you.

If you are willing to ask “what remains invariant?”, it is.
