1. Question (must be non-ontological)
What am I trying to explore without asserting what is real?
(Write one sentence. If it contains “is,” “really,” “fundamental,” or “actually,” rewrite it.)

2. Projection(s) Declared (circle or list)
☐ QM-PROJ-01


☐ REL-PROJ-01


☐ STAT-PROJ-01


☐ GRAV-PROJ-01


☐ FND-PROJ-01 (only if combining)


Why these and not others?
(One short sentence.)

3. Inputs (dimensionless ratios only)
List only normalized inputs. No units. No prose.
ψ_ratio =


H_ratio =


t_ratio =


v_ratio =


E_ratio =


S_ratio =


p_ratio[] =


r_ratio =


(add only what the projection requires)


If you cannot express an input as a ratio, stop here and record that as a result.

4. Projection Run (mechanical)
Method used:
☐ Code
☐ Hand-walk
☐ AI following projection JSON strictly

5. Outputs (numbers + flags only)
Record exactly what the projection returns.
Primary outputs:


Flags:


boundedness_violation = true / false


residual_flag_* =


unitarity / normalization / invariant = pass / fail


No interpretation here.

6. Did the framework halt?
☐ Yes
☐ No
If Yes, at what step and why?

7. Residuals (required if anything failed)
Check all that apply and note the trigger.
☐ Dropped mass


☐ Ambiguity


☐ Contradiction


☐ Unsupported assumptions


☐ High epistemic risk (kappa)


Trigger notes (brief, factual):
(e.g. “Normalization fails when v_ratio > 0.94”)

8. Ontology check (honesty test)
Did I feel tempted to say what this “means” about reality?
☐ Yes
☐ No
If yes, write the forbidden sentence here and cross it out:
“________________________________________”
(This is not for publication. It’s for discipline.)

9. Cross-projection note (optional)
If comparing domains:
Same regime tested across:


First invariant to fail:


Failure aligned or divergent?


One or two bullets only.

10. End-of-session statement (mandatory)
Complete exactly one:
☐ This regime is admissible under the declared projection(s).


☐ This regime fails under the declared projection(s).


☐ This regime cannot be evaluated without violating admissibility.


No conclusions beyond this.

Final rule (read every time)
If the framework halted, I halt.
If residuals appeared, I report them.
I do not resolve what the framework forbids.

That’s it.
That is the worksheet.
If you use this daily, two things will happen:
You will explore more slowly.


You will trust your thinking more.
